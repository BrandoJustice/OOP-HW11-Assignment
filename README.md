# OOP-HW11-Assignment
This repository holds my homework 11 assginment from my Object-Oriented Programming course at Lewis University

This program will allow user to type in details for creating a person object with
the person class. The person class will use Serialization to transfer the information
into a stream of bytes that will be located in a bin file. The user will
type in the person's name, email, phone number, and date of birth. After the user
typed the information for the person object, the program will create
the bin file that will store the person's details in. Next, the program will give the 
user 4 choices, to retrieve the information of the person object and output it to the user, to update a 
Information of the person object, to delete a information of the person object, or to end the program.
